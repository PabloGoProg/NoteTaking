## Conceptualization
- **Artificial Intelligence:** encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of perform tasks that typically requires human intelligence as:
	- Perception
	- Reasoning
	- Learning
	- Problem Solving
	- Decision Making
	_''Machines that mimic human behavior"._
- **Machine Learning:** Type of AI used to understand and build methods that can make machines able to learn - This methods use data to improve machine performance in different tasks.
	_"Machines that get better at a task without explicit programming"._
- **Deep Learning:** This field use the concepts of neurons and synapses _similar as out brain is wired_ to analyse and look for data patterns in complex data as images, text or video to produce valuable insights or predictions.
- **Generative AI:** subset of _Deep Learning_ cuz it adapts models using deep learning, but without retraining or Fine-Tuning
